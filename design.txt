# Inbest Design System Guidelines

## Core Design Principles

[CONTEXT]
Inbest is a modern investment portfolio platform that adheres to Apple's design philosophy while maintaining its unique identity. The following guidelines MUST be followed precisely to maintain design consistency across the platform.

[DESIGN PHILOSOPHY]
1. Design Uniformity
- REQUIRE all components to share consistent visual language
- ENSURE every page feels part of the same ecosystem
- MAINTAIN consistent spacing, typography, and interaction patterns
- FOLLOW Apple's component architecture principles

2. Apple-Inspired Design Language
- REPLICATE Apple's modern, clean aesthetic
- IMPLEMENT frosted glass effects (backdrop-blur) on floating elements
- USE subtle shadows and depth
- FOLLOW Apple's grid system and layout principles
- INCORPORATE smooth animations and transitions

3. Typography & Text
- USE SF Pro Display for headings (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont)
- USE SF Pro Text for body content
- FOLLOW Apple's type scale:
  * Large Title: 34px/40px
  * Title 1: 28px/34px
  * Title 2: 22px/28px
  * Title 3: 20px/25px
  * Body: 17px/22px
  * Footnote: 13px/18px

4. Color System
- Primary Brand Color: #2563EB (Inbest Blue)

  * Background: white, white/80 with backdrop-blur
  * Text: #1D1D1F (primary), #6E6E73 (secondary)
  * Borders: rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
  * Success: #00A852
  * Warning: #FF9F0A
  * Error: #FF3B30
  * Info: #007AFF

5. Component Design
- Border Radius:
  * Small elements: 8px
  * Medium elements: 12px
  * Large cards: 16px
  * Full rounded: 9999px
- Shadows:
  * Light: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.04)
  * Medium: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)
  * Heavy: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)

6. Data Visualization
- STRICTLY use Tremor.so components for all charts and data displays
- MAINTAIN consistent chart styling:
  * Chart background: transparent
  * Grid lines: minimal, light gray
  * Labels: SF Pro Text, 13px
  * Colors: Use defined color system
- ENSURE proper spacing around charts
- IMPLEMENT smooth animations for data updates

7. Layout & Spacing
- FOLLOW 8-point grid system
- Spacing scale:
  * 4px - Minimal spacing
  * 8px - Default spacing
  * 16px - Component spacing
  * 24px - Section spacing
  * 32px - Large section spacing
  * 48px - Page section spacing
- Container widths:
  * Max width: 1200px
  * Content width: 800px
  * Narrow width: 600px

8. Interaction & Animation
- IMPLEMENT subtle hover states
- USE spring animations for interactions
- FOLLOW Apple's animation timing:
  * Quick: 200ms
  * Standard: 300ms
  * Emphasis: 450ms
- ENSURE smooth transitions between states

9. Responsive Design
- MAINTAIN consistent experience across devices
- USE fluid typography
- IMPLEMENT graceful component scaling
- ENSURE proper spacing on all viewports

[IMPLEMENTATION RULES]
1. ALL new components MUST be reviewed against these guidelines
2. NO custom colors outside the defined palette
3. ALWAYS use the specified font stack
4. MAINTAIN consistent spacing throughout
5. ENSURE accessibility compliance
6. TEST all animations for performance
7. VERIFY responsive behavior

[EXAMPLES]
```tsx
// Button Component Example
<button className="inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-full bg-blue-600 px-4 py-1.5 text-sm font-medium text-white shadow-sm transition-all duration-200 hover:bg-blue-700 hover:scale-[1.02] active:scale-[0.98]">
  Sign up
</button>

// Card Component Example
<div className="bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-md rounded-2xl p-6 ring-1 ring-black/[0.04] shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-300">
  Content
</div>
```

[QUALITY CHECKS]
Before implementing any design:
1. VERIFY alignment with Apple's design principles
2. CHECK color contrast ratios
3. TEST component scalability
4. ENSURE consistent spacing
5. VALIDATE responsive behavior
6. CONFIRM animation performance

Remember: The goal is to create a premium, Apple-like experience while maintaining Inbest's unique identity through its brand color and investment-focused features.
